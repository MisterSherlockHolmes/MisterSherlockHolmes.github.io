	<p>Nowadays, we have various opinions about how to use mobile phone moderately.</p>
	<p>But at the beginning of today, we have the latest technology, the fastest Internet speed and none of it will make a difference.</p>
	<p>None of it will matter, unless all of you have a good self-control ability, unless you make a good use of it, unless you learn the right way to use the mobile phone, and put in the hard work it takes to be the owner of the mobile phone, but not let mobile phone become the owner of you.</p>
	<p>I believe everyone has read some of the articles talking about mobile phones. This is what I want to focus on today, the responsibility each of you has for your mobile phones and how to make a good use of mobile phones.</p>
	<p>Mobile phones can bring us convenience. In past 40 years, mobile phones completely transform the method of communication and has been seen as a an indispensable tool in our lives. This small gadget is a basic necessity of life. Here are some examples.</p>
	<p>Firstly, it’s a easy way to communicate. So the first and foremost role that mobile phones play in our lives is that they provide us an easy and fast way of communication. Go wherever you want, whenever you want; your mobile phone will stay you connected with all. You are able to just send instant SMS or call straight away and make your important message reach the intended person in no time when you want to an important message for your friend/family member.</p>
	<p>Secondly, Internet is thought to be one of the greatest invention in 20th century. You are able to use social media, watch video online, and search information anytime you want. The Internet also brings lots of profit in advertising, application, online business and digital entertainment.</p>
	<p>But in the other hand, mobile phone also brings disadvantages. By entering 21st century, digital entertainment was getting more and more popular. In past 10 years, people wasting too much time on applications such as TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, instagram and Twitter. And it can be difficult to relax in a social situation in the age of mobile phones. A call or text can come in at any time. Society generally expects you to have your phone switched on, charged up, and within reach at all times. Many callers or text senders can become annoyed if they don't get an immediate response.</p>
	<p>To sum up, there are both advantage and disadvantages of mobile phones. We will take a lot of advantages of phone and avoid disadvantages if we use mobile phone moderately. It is very important to use mobile phone moderately.</p>
	<p>That’s all for my speech.Thank You.</p>
